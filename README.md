Crypto Clustering 
--

In this challenge, youâ€™ll use your knowledge of Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.

**Prepare the data**
1. Use the StandardScaler() module from scikit-learn to normalize the data from the CSV file.
2. Create a DataFrame with the scaled data and set the "coin_id" index from the original DataFrame as the index for the new DataFrame.

**Analysis with original scaled data**
1.Find the Best Value for k Using the Original Scaled DataFrame
2.Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the Original Scaled Data
3.Optimize Clusters with Principal Component Analysis

**PCA Analysis**
1.Find the Best Value for k Using the PCA Data
2.Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the PCA Data

**Answer to the question**
What is the impact of using fewer features to cluster the data using K-Means?
